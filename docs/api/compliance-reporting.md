## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Insufficient Compliance Data
```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient data for comprehensive compliance assessment",
  "error_code": "INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
  "recommendations": ["Enable additional logging", "Deploy missing monitoring tools"]
}
```

**Solution**: Ensure all required monitoring and logging components are active

#### Framework Not Supported
```json
{
  "error": "Compliance framework 'CUSTOM-FRAMEWORK' not supported",
  "error_code": "UNSUPPORTED_FRAMEWORK",
  "supported_frameworks": ["PCI-DSS", "HIPAA", "SOX", "GDPR", "NIST"]
}
```

**Solution**: Use one of the supported frameworks or contact support for custom framework development

#### Report Generation Timeout
```json
{
  "error": "Report generation timeout - dataset too large",
  "error_code": "TIMEOUT",
  "suggestions": ["Reduce report scope", "Use agent-specific filtering"]
}
```

**Solution**: Narrow report scope or generate reports for specific time periods/agents

### Performance Optimization

1. **Scoped Assessments**: Use agent-specific assessments for large environments
2. **Incremental Reports**: Generate reports for specific time periods
3. **Caching Strategy**: Leverage cached compliance data when appropriate
4. **Parallel Processing**: Enable concurrent assessment of multiple frameworks
